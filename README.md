WP Toolbar as a timesaver, here is my 4D Write Pro Toolbar (based on the original source from 4D https://github.com/4d/4D-WritePro-Interface)


Changes:

    • Arrangement of the icons according to my needs
    • Remove the light blue toolbar style
    • Font PopUp as hierarchic PopUp
    • Fonts PopUp also shows the subfonts
    • Fonts PopUp shows the last used fonts in the document
    • ustomize table and cell formats to selectively set frames on the left, top, right, bottom.
    • and a few more small adjustments

I have added some color sets with Photoshop. So everyone can choose a favorite color
